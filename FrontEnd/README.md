# Angular-Office-Management
Angular frontend

Issues:
1. Fix inventory quickedit update error msg in javascript console
2. Fix CORS issue in .NET
3. Fix empty email in profile update and also email error check
4. Need to check why response is sometimes parsed as msg.text and sometimes msg. i.e. inventory quick edit vs create.


Some helpful commands,
1. 'npm install --save-dev @angular/cli@latest' to fix 'could not find module '@angular-devkit/build-angular' issue.



Need to fix:
1. Inventory quick edit success shows error msg in log
2. pagination for inventory list added, add to others similarly
